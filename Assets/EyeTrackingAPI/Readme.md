### Adhawk Eyetracking API Package

This is the unity package that contains the API used to communicate with the backend server that handles eyetracking requests connected to an eyetracking device.

Most functions you will need will be found by using `EyeTrackerApi.Instance` object. This needs to be added to a camera in your scene.
